![](Intro_image.jpg)

## üìå Project Overview
This project uses the Human Resources Dataset from Kaggle to answer critical HR business questions while practicing Excel data cleaning, analysis, and visualization skills.

### The objective is to:
- Clean and prepare the dataset
- Create helper columns for analysis
- Answer questions using pivot tables & charts
- Develop KPIs
- Summarize findings.

---
## üõ† Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Conditional Formatting & Formulas)
- GitHub for documentation
- Kaggle for dataset source

 ---
## üìÇ Dataset Information
- Source: [Human Resources Dataset ‚Äì Kaggle]
- File: HRDataset_v14.csv
- Rows: 311
- Columns: 35 (various HR details like Employee Name, Department, DOB, Termination Date, Performance Score, etc.)

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preparation
Data cleaning was done entirely in Excel before analysis.
### 1. Converted Dataset to an Excel Table
- Selected the entire dataset ‚Üí Insert ‚Üí Table.
- This allows for structured referencing and easy filtering.
### 2. Data Type Conversion; 
- Salary column changed to currency üí≤ data type.
- State column, using the **find and replace** function, used to correct the wrong abbreviation of state column to full state name to enable map üó∫Ô∏è.
### 2. Helper Columns
We added the following calculated fields for analysis:
#### a) Tenure (in Years)
Formula:
``=ROUND((IF(ISBLANK([DateofTermination]), TODAY (), [DateofTermination])-[DateofHire]) /365, 1)``
(ISBLANK ensures empty cells are correctly detected and Avoids Excel‚Äôs default 1/0/1900 issue for empty date cells.)
#### b) Employment Status
To indicate whether an employee is active or terminated:
excel
``=IF(ISBLANK([@DateofTermination]),"Active","Terminated")`
#### c) Age
To calculate employee age from DOB:
`excel 
``=ROUND DOWN((TODAY()-[DOB]) / 365, 0)`
#### d) Termination
``=IF(ISBLANK([@DateofTermination]),0 ,1)``

## üìä Analysis Questions / Insights
Questions were answered using Pivot Tables & Charts:

**Q1: Is there a relationship between who a person works for and their performance score?**

Pivot Table: ManagerName (Rows) vs. PerformanceScore (Values = Count).
Across managers, the majority of employees have a ‚ÄúFully Meets‚Äù performance rating, with ‚ÄúNeeds Improvement‚Äù cases being rare with the highest count for a manager is only 3.

**Q2: What is the overall diversity profile of the organization?**

Pivot Table: RaceDesc & Gender distribution.
The workforce consists of 43% male and 57% female employees. The majority race is White (45%), followed by Black or African American (30%), Asian (15%), and others. Most employees are single (137), while (124) are married and the rest are divorced or separated.

**Q3: What are the best recruiting sources for ensuring a diverse organization?**

Pivot Table: RecruitmentSource vs. RaceDesc.
LinkedIn, indeed and Google search were top sources for hiring racially diverse candidates. Diversity job fair recruitment favored Black American or African 

**Q4: Are there areas of the company where pay is not equitable?**

Analysis shows that while the overall average pay is $69,020.68 
notable disparities exist.
